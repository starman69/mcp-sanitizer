# MCP Sanitizer - Performance Benchmarks

## üîí Security First, Performance Second, Developer Experience Third

This directory contains performance benchmarks for the MCP Sanitizer library. These benchmarks ensure our security implementations maintain excellent performance while **NEVER** compromising security integrity.

## üö® Critical Security Notice

> **WARNING**: Performance optimizations MUST NOT compromise security.
> - All bypass attempts MUST result in benchmark failure
> - Memory usage MUST remain bounded during attacks
> - Response times MUST be consistent to prevent timing attacks
> - False negatives (missed attacks) are UNACCEPTABLE

## üìä Benchmark Scripts

### 1. `library-performance.js`

**Purpose**: Compares the performance of trusted security libraries versus custom implementations.

**What it tests**:
- **HTML Encoding**: `escape-html` vs regex-based encoding
- **SQL Escaping**: `sqlstring` vs custom SQL escape functions
- **Command Escaping**: `shell-quote` vs custom shell escaping

**Why this matters**: 
- Validates our decision to use battle-tested security libraries
- Ensures we're not sacrificing security for marginal performance gains
- Provides baseline performance metrics for security operations

**Run it**:
```bash
node benchmark/library-performance.js
```

### 2. `skip-paths-performance.js`

**Purpose**: Benchmarks the skipPaths feature optimization comparing O(n) linear search vs optimized O(1)/O(log n) implementations.

**What it tests**:
- Path matching performance with various config sizes (50-5000 paths)
- String exact matching vs prefix matching vs RegExp patterns
- Memory usage and cache efficiency
- Real-world scenario simulation with mixed pattern types

**Why this matters**:
- Ensures path skipping doesn't become a bottleneck
- Validates that optimization doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities
- Confirms performance improvements scale with config size

**Run it**:
```bash
node benchmark/skip-paths-performance.js
```

### 3. `advanced-security-benchmark.js` üîê **[NEW]**

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security validation testing advanced attack vectors and adversarial scenarios.

**What it tests**:
- **XSS Vectors**: DOM-based, attribute injection, CSS injection, polyglot payloads
- **SQL Injection**: Blind, time-based, second-order, NoSQL injection
- **Command Injection**: Environment variables, Unicode bypass, process substitution
- **Path Traversal**: Encoded traversal, UNC paths, absolute paths
- **Timing Attack Resistance**: Ensures consistent response times
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Tests with large payloads and bounded memory usage

**Critical Security Checks**:
- Zero false negatives (NO attacks should pass through)
- Bounded memory usage under attack (< 100MB)
- Consistent timing to prevent information leakage
- Complete attack vector coverage

**Run it**:
```bash
node benchmark/advanced-security-benchmark.js
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This benchmark uses REAL attack vectors. Any failure indicates a security vulnerability.

## üéØ Benchmark Best Practices

### For Security Libraries

1. **Always Test Attack Vectors First**
   - Benchmark MUST include malicious payloads
   - Security validation comes before performance metrics
   - Any optimization that fails security tests is rejected

2. **Measure Security Overhead**
   ```javascript
   const securityOverhead = (secureTime - unsafeTime) / unsafeTime * 100;
   // Acceptable overhead: < 20% for critical paths
   ```

3. **Test Boundary Conditions**
   - Maximum input sizes
   - Unicode and encoding edge cases
   - Null bytes and special characters
   - Deeply nested structures

4. **Prevent Timing Attacks**
   - Ensure consistent response times
   - Add random delays if necessary
   - Never leak information through timing

### For the Technical Community

1. **Reproducible Results**
   - Use fixed seed for random data
   - Document system specifications
   - Include warmup runs
   - Report percentiles, not just averages

2. **Real-World Scenarios**
   - Mix of benign and malicious inputs
   - Varying input sizes and complexity
   - Concurrent request simulation
   - Cache hit/miss scenarios

3. **Security-First Metrics**
   ```javascript
   // Priority order for optimization decisions
   const metrics = {
     1: 'Security Coverage',      // Must be 100%
     2: 'False Negative Rate',    // Must be 0%
     3: 'Memory Safety',          // Must be bounded
     4: 'Performance',            // Then optimize speed
     5: 'Developer Experience'    // Finally, ease of use
   };
   ```

## üìù Interpreting Results

### Key Metrics

1. **Operations per Second (ops/sec)**
   - Higher is better
   - Compare relative performance, not absolute
   - Consider security validation rate

2. **Relative Margin of Error (¬±%)**
   - Lower is better (more consistent)
   - ¬±2% or less indicates stable results
   - High variance may indicate security issues

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Must remain bounded under attack
   - Watch for memory leaks
   - Track peak usage during benchmarks

### Red Flags üö©

- Performance improvement with reduced security coverage
- Inconsistent timing (possible information leakage)
- Memory growth during extended runs
- Optimization that changes security behavior
- False negative rate > 0%

## üé® Adding New Benchmarks

### Template for Security Benchmarks

```javascript
const Benchmark = require('benchmark');

// 1. Security validation FIRST
const securityTests = [
  { input: 'malicious', expected: 'blocked' },
  { input: 'benign', expected: 'allowed' }
];

// 2. Verify security before benchmarking
for (const test of securityTests) {
  const result = sanitizer.process(test.input);
  if (result !== test.expected) {
    throw new Error(`SECURITY FAILURE: ${test.input}`);
  }
}

// 3. Then benchmark performance
const suite = new Benchmark.Suite('Security Feature');

suite
  .add('Implementation A', () => {
    // Benchmark code
  })
  .add('Implementation B', () => {
    // Benchmark code
  })
  .on('cycle', (event) => {
    console.log(String(event.target));
  })
  .on('complete', function() {
    console.log('Fastest:', this.filter('fastest').map('name'));
    // 4. Verify security wasn't compromised
    runSecurityValidation();
  })
  .run({ async: true });
```
