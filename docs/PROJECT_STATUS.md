# MCP Sanitizer Project Status

## Overview

The MCP Sanitizer v1.0.0 is complete and ready for release. This is a comprehensive security sanitization library for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## Current State

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Multi-layered protection against all major attack vectors
- ✅ Context-aware sanitization for different input types
- ✅ Integration of trusted security libraries
- ✅ Pre-configured security policies (STRICT, MODERATE, PERMISSIVE, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION)
- ✅ Middleware support for Express, Fastify, and Koa
- ✅ Fluent configuration builder API
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (116 tests, all passing)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks included
- ✅ Full documentation

### Technical Architecture
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Validators for URL, file path, command, and SQL inputs
- Pattern detection for various attack types
- Configurable security policies
- Extensible middleware system

### Security Libraries Used
- **escape-html**: HTML entity encoding
- **sqlstring**: SQL escaping
- **shell-quote**: Shell command escaping
- **validator**: URL and string validation
- **sanitize-filename**: Filename sanitization
- **path-is-inside**: Path containment checking

### Quality Metrics
- **Tests**: 116 (all passing)
- **ESLint**: 0 errors
- **Performance**: All operations <0.5ms
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive with detailed reports

## Usage

```javascript
// Simple usage
const MCPSanitizer = require('mcp-sanitizer');
const sanitizer = new MCPSanitizer('STRICT');

// With Express
const { createMCPMiddleware } = require('mcp-sanitizer');
app.use(createMCPMiddleware());
```
