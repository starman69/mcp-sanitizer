# Security Documentation

## Overview

MCP Sanitizer provides comprehensive, defense-in-depth protection against common web application attack vectors through multi-layered validation, advanced Unicode normalization, and context-aware sanitization.

## Security Features

### Core Protection Layers

1. **Multi-layered Validation**
   - Command injection prevention using shell-quote
   - SQL injection protection via sqlstring
   - XSS prevention through escape-html
   - Path traversal blocking with path-is-inside
   - NoSQL injection detection for MongoDB operators

2. **Advanced Unicode & Encoding Defense**
   - Homograph attack prevention (Cyrillic, Greek, mathematical symbols)
   - Multi-pass normalization (handles nested encoding)
   - Zero-width character detection and removal
   - Directional override character blocking (RLO/LRO)
   - Full-width character normalization

3. **Context-Aware Sanitization**
   - Different validation rules for file paths, URLs, commands, and SQL
   - Protocol-specific validation (HTTP/HTTPS/FTP/MCP)
   - Database-specific SQL injection detection (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle)

## Security Enhancements

### 1. Directional Override Detection
Prevents Unicode text direction manipulation attacks commonly used in file name spoofing.

```javascript
// Attack: "invoice.doc" that's actually "invoice<RLO>cod.exe"
const result = detectDirectionalOverrides('invoice\u202Ecod.exe');
// Detected and sanitized
```

### 2. Null Byte Protection
Prevents C-style string termination attacks that can bypass validation.

```javascript
// Attack: Bypass extension checks with null bytes
const result = sanitize('malicious.php\0.txt');
// Null bytes stripped, attack prevented
```

### 3. Multi-Layer Encoding Defense
Handles double and triple encoding attempts.

```javascript
// Attack: Double URL encoded path traversal
const result = sanitize('%252e%252e%252f');
// Decoded through multiple passes, attack blocked
```

### 4. Database-Specific SQL Protection
Detects database-specific injection patterns:
- PostgreSQL dollar quotes: `$$; DROP TABLE users; --$$`
- MySQL backticks: `` `users`; DROP TABLE `accounts` ``
- MSSQL Unicode strings: `N'; DROP TABLE users; --'`
- Oracle alternative quoting: `q'['; DROP TABLE users; --]'`

### 5. Homograph Attack Prevention
Normalizes look-alike characters used in phishing:
- Cyrillic '–∞' (U+0430) ‚Üí Latin 'a' (U+0061)
- Greek 'Œø' (U+03BF) ‚Üí Latin 'o' (U+006F)  
- Mathematical 'ùíÇ' (U+1D482) ‚Üí Latin 'a' (U+0061)

## Security Policies

| Policy | Use Case | String Limit | Protocols | Blocking Level |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **STRICT** | Untrusted input | 1,000 chars | HTTPS only | Medium+ |
| **MODERATE** | Balanced security | 5,000 chars | HTTP/HTTPS/MCP | High+ |
| **PERMISSIVE** | Trusted environments | 50,000 chars | All | Critical only |
| **DEVELOPMENT** | Development/debugging | 20,000 chars | HTTP/HTTPS/MCP/File | High+ |
| **PRODUCTION** | Production systems | 8,000 chars | HTTPS/MCP | High+ |

## Security Philosophy

### What We Provide
- **Comprehensive protection** against known attack vectors (42+ attack patterns validated)
- **Defense-in-depth** with 12 validation layers (command injection, SQL, NoSQL, XSS, path traversal, etc.)
- **Multi-pass validation**: Unicode normalization (NFC/NFD/NFKC/NFKD), multi-layer encoding detection
- **Regular updates** based on emerging threats and CodeQL analysis
- **Extensive test coverage** with 670 security tests (zero false negatives)
- **Production performance**: Sub-millisecond average latency (<1ms) for comprehensive validation

### What We Don't Claim
- We do **NOT** claim 100% protection against all attacks
- Zero-day vulnerabilities may exist
- New attack vectors emerge constantly
- Security is a continuous process, not a destination

### Best Practices
1. **Always use the strictest policy** appropriate for your use case
2. **Keep the library updated** to get latest security patches
3. **Implement defense-in-depth** - don't rely on a single security layer
4. **Monitor and log** blocked attempts for security analysis
5. **Report vulnerabilities** via GitHub Security Advisories

## Threat Model

### Protected Against
- **Command injection** (shell commands, environment variables, process substitution)
- **SQL injection** (all major databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle)
- **NoSQL injection** (MongoDB operators, query injection)
- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** (DOM-based, attribute injection, polyglot payloads)
- **Path traversal attacks** (directory traversal, absolute paths, UNC paths)
- **Prototype pollution** (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` injection)
- **Template injection** (server-side template injection, expression language)
- **Unicode-based bypasses** (homographs, directional overrides, normalization attacks)
- **Encoding-based evasion** (multi-layer encoding, nested URL encoding)
- **Homograph/phishing attacks** (Cyrillic, Greek, mathematical symbols)
- **ReDoS attacks** (polynomial backtracking, catastrophic backtracking - 22 patterns hardened)

### Assumptions
- Input is untrusted by default
- Attackers may use sophisticated encoding/obfuscation
- Multiple attack vectors may be combined
- Validation patterns themselves must be hardened against pathological inputs

### Out of Scope
- DDoS protection (infrastructure concern)
- Rate limiting (application layer)
- Authentication/authorization (application logic)
- Business logic vulnerabilities
- Timing attack protection

## Testing

The library includes comprehensive test coverage:
- **670 security tests** covering all major attack vectors
- **42 attack vector validations** across XSS, SQL injection, command injection, path traversal
- **100% detection rate** with zero false negatives
- **Unicode security tests** for homograph attacks and directional override detection
- **Database-specific tests** for SQL injection variants (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle)
- **ReDoS protection tests** for 22 polynomial backtracking vulnerabilities
- **Performance benchmarks**: Sub-millisecond average latency (<1ms) validating 12 security layers

### Performance

Production-ready validation with minimal overhead:

| Metric | Value | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Average Latency** | <1ms | Sub-millisecond response times |
| **Throughput** | 7,500+ ops/sec | Per CPU core |
| **Attack Detection** | 0.28ms - 2.39ms | All vectors blocked quickly |
| **Memory Usage** | <60MB typical | Efficient resource usage |

**Validation Efficiency:**
- 4 Unicode normalization passes (NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD)
- Multi-layer encoding detection (URL, Unicode, nested)
- 12 validation layers checking 42+ attack patterns
- ReDoS-protected patterns with timeout guards
- All operations complete in sub-millisecond timeframes
- Use `skipPaths` middleware option for performance-critical routes

## Responsible Disclosure

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Security Issues
1. **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Use GitHub Security Advisories or email security contact
3. Include proof-of-concept if possible
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure

### Response Timeline
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Based on severity (Critical: 7 days, High: 14 days, Medium: 30 days)
- **Credit**: Security researchers will be credited (unless they prefer anonymity)
